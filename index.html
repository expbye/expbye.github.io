        <h1 id="expbyecom"><a href="http://ExpbyE.com">ExpbyE.com</a></h1>
<p><a href="http://ExpbyE.com">ExpbyE.com</a> is a site where I explore, explain, express, expound, and exp* stuff. Mostly techie internetty stuff. It's mostly for my own edification, but if you find some value here, congratulations for finding it.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>There's a large construction project beatifully visible through my study window. I want to use AWS to help track and analyze progress. This site will function as sort of a behind the scenes of the actual project which will (hopefully) be more polished and presentable.</p>
<p>I'm going to do things with this site that are not the best or the fastest or the hippest way to resolve the issue. In many cases, I'll be doing something the old-fashioned way here so when I do it on the project page I can more fully appreciate the power of AWS.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>At first, there will be three main sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://expbye.com/blog.html">Blog</a> - this will be an infrequently updated discussion of what I'm working on</li>
<li>How-to - This will have more structured instructions on how to do things I found useful</li>
<li><a href="http://expbye.com/armory.html">Armory</a> - This will be a frequently updated list of languages, services, programs, and whatever else that I use developing the site. This may also include things that I consider but ultimately don't use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Second pass - expanding to five sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://expbye.com/blog.html">Blog</a> - written in a conversational tone intended for all audiences regardless of technical experience.</li>
<li>Glossary - Quick explanations of important concepts, services, and tools that I'm using to complete my task. Also written for all audiences.</li>
<li>How-to - This will be step-by-step, illustrated tutorials for various parts of my process. This will be written to bridge audiences; it's intended to give less technical users the courage to dip their toes into the deep end, or for more technical users to easily follow along. This will be the least frequently portion of this site, but will probably be where I spend most of my time.</li>
<li><a href="http://expbye.com/armory.html">Armory</a> - Essentially the glossary, but written for more experienced tech users. This will include specific usage information, like snippets of code and OS or AWS configuration details. I'll also include links to useful tutorials I find elsewhere. Intended as a quick reference for more experienced users.</li>
<li>Notes - This will be a stream of consciousness collection of links, observations, and considerations as I develop this project. It's not really intended for other audiences, but it may be interesting enough for a casual glance from very bored people.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="historicity">Historicity</h2>
<p>I need to choose a way to visually track changes to the site so I can look back and see how I improve. For example, initial launch will be a simple index.html with no images and no links or menus or anything else. Early improvements will include adding navigation elements and css.</p>
