# ExpbyE.com

ExpbyE.com is a site where I explore, explain, express, expound, and exp\* stuff. Mostly techie internetty stuff. It's mostly for my own edification, but if you find some value here, congratulations for finding it.

## Purpose

There's a large construction project beatifully visible through my study window. I want to use AWS to help track and analyze progress. This site will function as sort of a behind the scenes of the actual project which will (hopefully) be more polished and presentable.

I'm going to do things with this site that are not the best or the fastest or the hippest way to resolve the issue. In many cases, I'll be doing something the old-fashioned way here so when I do it on the project page I can more fully appreciate the power of AWS.

## Organization

At first, there will be three main sections:

1. Blog - this will be an infrequently updated discussion of what I'm working on
2. How-to - This will have more structured instructions on how to do things I found useful
3. [Armory](https://expbye.github.io/armory.html) - This will be a frequently updated list of languages, services, programs, and whatever else that I use developing the site. This may also include things that I consider but ultimately don't use.

## Historicity

I need to choose a way to visually track changes to the site so I can look back and see how I improve. For example, initial launch will be a simple index.html with no images and no links or menus or anything else. Early improvements will include adding navigation elements and css.
